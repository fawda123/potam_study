Materials for manuscript describing drivers of Potamogeton species distribution in temperate lakes

## Data for each 

* `mn_potam.RData` Minnesota data, frequency occurrence of potamogeton species and supporting data for each lake

* `wi_potam.RData` Wisconsin data, frequency occurrence of potamogeton species and supporting data for each lake

Supporting data include morphometry, water quality, climate, and spatial variables:

* morphometry: lake area (km2), perimeter (km), and max depth (km)

* water quality: alkalinity, water colour, secchi depth, and phosphorous

* climate:  mean temp, maximum temp, minimum temp, precip, and altitude

* spatial: lat, long
